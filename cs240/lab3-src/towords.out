100: That
101: makes
102: calamity
103: of
104: so
105: long
106: life;

134: of
135: office,
136: and
137: the
138: spurns
139: That
140: patient
141: merit
142: of
143: the
144: unworthy
145: takes,
146: When
147: he
148: himself
149: might
150: his
151: quietus
152: make
153: With
154: a
155: bare
156: bodkin?
157: who
158: would
159: these
160: fardels
161: bear,
162: To
163: grunt
164: and
165: sweat
166: under
167: a
168: weary
169: life,
170: But
171: that
172: the
173: dread

208: Thus
209: conscience
210: does
211: make
212: cowards
213: of
