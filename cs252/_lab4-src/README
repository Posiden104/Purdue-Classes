In step 3 (thr1) the output consisted of a seemingly random assortment of A's B's and C's, often with a single letter repeating for a short time.

In step 5 (thr2) the output consisted of only C's being printed. This is because when the to printC("c") is made, it enters an infinite loop the main thread never reaches the thread execution.


											System Time			User Time		Real Time
pthread_mutex(count)					|	.00s			|	.26s		|	.147s		|
spin lock (count_spin with thr_yield)	|	.45s			|	.27s		|	.366s		|
spin lock (count_spin without thr_yield)|	.00s			|	1.57s		|	.839s		|

1. without yield, count_spin completely blocks the system until one thread finishes the work load, then moves on to the next thread. With yield, count_spin can interweave the execution

2. when count_spin has yield, it waits, using system time to wait on the resource to become avaliable.
