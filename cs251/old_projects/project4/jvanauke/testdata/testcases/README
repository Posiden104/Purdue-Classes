Sample testcase formats:

Tests 1 and 2 are sample testcases from part 1, one small and one large case.
They were run in the testcases directory with the following commands:

./program 1 test1 out1 3 chunks1/
./program 1 test2 out2 10000 chunks2/

The file structure in this folder represents the correct output.

Test 3 does not have a textfile input. It was run with the following command

./program 2 out1 aaa aba car

You can check these testcases against your own program using

diff -Bis file1 file2
